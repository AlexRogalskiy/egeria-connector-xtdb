# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates will always be applied to the latest `-SNAPSHOT` prior to being included in the latest release. We generally do not backport security updates given that the connector itself is intended to be backwards compatible between (minor) releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please consider raising an issue. If there are sensitive details that you do not want to risk including directly in an issue, you can alternatively email the (non-public) Egeria security team at: egeria-security@lists.lfaidata.foundation

Please ideally include:

- details on where the vulnerability exists (e.g. in connector code itself, a dependent library, etc)
- point to any existing CVE or other published details on the vulnerability (if available)
- give a brief summary of the impact of the vulnerability (if not immediately obvious from the above)

We will triage these details and determine the appropriate course of action, typically including:

- publishing a security advisory alerting the community to the vulnerability
- suggesting approaches to avoid the vulnerability (e.g. fixes and / or interim workarounds)
